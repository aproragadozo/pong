'W' and 'S' keys control the left paddle, 'Up' and 'Down' arrows control the right paddle.
Planned upgrades:
* Two game modes:
  * First past the post: Choose target score at start, whichever player reaches it first wins.
  * Set number of balls, player with the highest score when balls run out wins.
* Ball speeds up slightly each time it hits a paddle; ball speeds resets after a player misses.
* Paddle can "spin" ball: paddle movement when ball bounces off affects ball movement
* Power-ups:
  * Sticky
  * Multi-ball
  * Larger/smaller paddle
  * Larger/smaller ball
  * Flashing background
